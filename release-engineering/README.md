### Quarterly

- New minor releases
 
### Monthly

- Patch releases
  - Cut the three most recent minor versions
  - A week before each patch deadline, have an updated status report on all cherry picks
 
### Weekly

- Cherry pick triage and approval
- Provide status updates at Release Team meetings
 
### Ongoing

- Cut prereleases (alpha, beta, release candidate) for the minor release in development
 
### Ad Hoc

- Update Golang versions in Kubernetes
- Update core Kubernetes base images
