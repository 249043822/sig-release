## Patch Release Team

The Patch Release Team is responsible for coordinating patch releases (`x.y.z`, where `z` >= 0) of Kubernetes. This team at times works in close conjunction with the [Product Security Committee](https://git.k8s.io/community/committee-product-security/README.md) and therefore should abide by the guidelines set forth in the [Security Release Process](https://git.k8s.io/security/security-release-process.md).

## SIG Release Chairs

SIG Release Chairs are responsible for the governance of SIG Release. They are mentioned explicitly here as they are owners of the various communications channels and permissions groups (GitHub teams, GCP access) for each role.

As such, they are highly privileged community members and privy to some private communications, which can at times relate to Kubernetes security disclosures.
