# SIG Release

## Mission
- Production of high quality Kubernetes releases on a reliable schedule

  - Manage the creation of release specific artifacts including
    - Code branches
    - Binary distributions
    - Release notes
- Continually improving release and development processes
  - Work closely with SIG Contributor Experience to define and build tools to facilitate release process (e.g. dashboards)
  - Work with downstream communities responsible for packaging Kubernetes releases
  - Work with other SIGs to agree upon the responsibilities of their SIG with respect to the release
  - Define and collect metrics related to the release in order to measure progress over each release
- Collaboration with downstream communities which build artifacts from Kubernetes releases
  - Ensure the appropriate level of integration with publishing the OSS build artifacts

## Release Team

Several of the responsibilities of SIG Release are discharged by the Release Team, a subproject of SIG Release. Explicit details on each of the roles can be found in the [Release Team subproject directory][rt-directory].
