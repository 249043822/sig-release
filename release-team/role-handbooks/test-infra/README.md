The Test Infra role was deprecated at the end of the Kubernetes 1.15 release cycle.
Beginning with the Kubernetes 1.16 release cycle, the duties of the Test Infra role have been spread across the following:
- Release Managers, specifically the [Branch Manager](/release-team/role-handbooks/branch-manager/README.md)
- [Bug Triage (Release Team)](/release-team/role-handbooks/branch-manager/README.md)
- [Test Infra On-call (SIG Testing)](https://go.k8s.io/oncall) (#testing-ops and #sig-testing on Slack)

This file is a placeholder to preserve links.  Please remove after 3 months or the release of Kubernetes 1.16, whichever comes first.
